# Introduction

This section has various algorithmic and programming tasks. Some of them are original, but most are inspired by tasks from various services like UVA or SPOJ. Each task consists of a description and solution - implementation. Additional tips may also appear with some tasks. We encourage you to solve the task yourself before looking at the solution.

The task is essentially always the same: propose an algorithm and/or write a program according to the description and specification.
