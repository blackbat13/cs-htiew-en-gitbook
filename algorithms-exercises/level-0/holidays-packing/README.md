# Holidays packing

## Description

Finally holidays! Time to go somewhere. First, however, it's time to pack. You have one suitcase in the shape of a cuboid with dimensions $$20cm \times 20cm \times 20cm$$. You managed to collect all the necessary things into one small package, also in the shape of a cuboid. The question is, will it fit into the suitcase? You don't want to damage anything, so the package cannot protrude and must be arranged by sides parallel to the sides of the suitcase.
