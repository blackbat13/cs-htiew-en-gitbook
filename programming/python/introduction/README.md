# Introduction

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note this is not a programming tutorial. The assumption is that you already know a bit about programming, maybe you know a different programming language and want to know what basic constructs look like in Python 3. 

**We will not explain here what a loop or conditional statement is, but we will only show what these constructs look like. in Python 3. **

**If you're just getting started, read the Introduction to Algorithms first**: [**Introduction**](../../../algorithms/introduction/)****

## Local environment 

### Installing the interpreter 

Download the latest version of the Python 3 interpreter from the [following page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) ("Download Python" button at the top of the page). 

### Installing the IDE

Download the free [Pycharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) IDE. Remember to choose the version intended for your operating system. Install by following the installer's instructions.

## Web environments 

Unlike local environments, web environments are accessible from the browser level and do not require any additional installation. This, of course, has its advantages and disadvantages. Web environments usually run slower and have their limitations. 

### Ideone 

Pretty basic web compiler. It supports many different languages. Its advantages include relatively quick compilation and the ability to use without registration, as well as the ease of sharing your codes. The disadvantages include the lack of interactivity - the entire input must be entered in a special window, before starting the program.

### Repl.it 

A powerful web-based tool, but requires a free account. It supports many languages and allows you to create complex projects with a complex file structure, as well as introduce your own compilation options.
