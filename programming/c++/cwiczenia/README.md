# Exercises

## Description

Please read the description below before proceeding with the solving tasks.

Make your solutions readable, both from the code side and the messages you write. If there is a specification, you can assume that the data will conform to the specification. Input data should be read from standard input. It can be assumed that all integers will fit in the integer type (unless otherwise stated).

Take the time to solve each task. Consider different approaches and solutions to the problem.

Tasks are divided according to topics. The topics are arranged in the suggested order of learning about the topics. Each topic contains from a few to a dozen or so tasks. After expanding the topic, sample solutions for individual tasks will appear, each on a separate page. Remember that each task can be solved in several ways.
