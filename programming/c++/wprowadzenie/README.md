# Introduction

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note this is not a programming tutorial. The assumption is that you already know a bit about programming, maybe you know a different programming language and want to know what basic constructs look like in C++.

**We will not explain here what a loop or conditional statement is, but we will only show what these constructs look like in C++.**

**If you're just getting started, read the Introduction to Algorithms first:** [**Introduction**](../../../algorithms/introduction/).

## Local integrated development environment (IDE)

### Code::Blocks

A good environment for beginners. Easy to use, transparent and free. It allows creating extensive projects as well as simple console applications.

#### Installation

Download the installer from: [https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/). We can install the environment itself, or together in a package with a compiler. In order to install the full set, i.e. environment plus compiler, select the version with **mingw**, e.g. **codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe**.

### **Dev-C++**

Another good and free environment for beginners. In its possibilities similar to the previously discussed Code::Blocks IDE.

#### Installation

Download the installer from: [http://bloodshed.net/](http://bloodshed.net). Like with Code::Blocks, we can install the environment itself, or together with the Mingw compiler.

### Visual Studio

An extensive and powerful environment created by Microsoft. Recommended for experienced programmers. When creating applications in C ++, you should keep in mind that Visual Studio adds its own libraries.

#### Installation

Download the installer from: [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com). There are several versions available for download, both paid and free. For standard "home" applications, a free version, i.e. Community Edition, is sufficient.

### Visual Studio Code

With their foundations, Visual Studio Code is a text editor, something like an extensive notebook. What distinguishes it, however, is the possibility of expanding with the help of various additions / plugins. Light, pleasant, free and with huge possibilities. It requires some time to learn to use it effectively, but it's worth it.

#### Installation

Download the installer from: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com).

### CLion

Powerful, extensive and (unfortunately) paid tool created by JetBrains, intended primarily for creating advanced projects. It has many useful tools for programmers, as well as the options of fast code reflectors and built-in hints. It is worth paying attention to the fact that Clion uses CMake by default to configure and compile projects.

These and other tools from JetBrains are available for free on the educational license: [https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)

#### Installation

Download the installer from: [https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

## Web environment

Unlike local environments, web environments are accessible from the browser level and do not require any additional installation. This, of course, has its advantages and disadvantages. Web environments usually run slower and have their limitations. 

### Ideone

Pretty basic web compiler. It supports numerous programming languages. Its advantages include relatively quick compilation and the ability to use without registration, as well as the ease of sharing your codes. The disadvantages include the lack of interactivity - the entire input must be entered in a special window, before starting the program.

### Repl.it

A powerful web-based tool, but requires a free account. It supports many languages and allows you to create complex projects with a complex file structure, as well as introduce your own compilation options.
