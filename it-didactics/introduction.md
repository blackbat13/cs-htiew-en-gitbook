# Introduction

Most of the material on this site is intended for both students and students (actually anyone wanting to learn something) and teachers. However, there are topics that are typically addressed to teachers and people interested in the broadly understood didactics of computer science, or methods of teaching computer science. Such topics and materials can be found in this section.
