# Introduction

Most programming courses look very similar: we learn the basics of language by performing simple exercises, operating primarily on numbers, texts and writing messages to the console. In such courses, writing your own simplified version of the console calculator or a similar program is often an achievement. The whole interaction with our program usually comes down to entering data in the console and observing emerging text messages. As my student once stated: 
> When I show my mother how the program works, it doesn't impress her. Oh, some text appears on the screen. 

And no wonder! In short, this is not very impressive, especially for people who do not know programming. And yet when we learn something new, we often want to boast of acquired skills in front of our family and friends!

This is one of the reasons why I suggest a different approach to learning programming. Learning by creating games and animations.
