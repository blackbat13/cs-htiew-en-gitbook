## Suggested order

The course is divided into several parts so that everyone can find something for themselves. Below I will try to briefly describe each of them and who it is intended for.

### Introduction

If you haven't had the opportunity to learn programming yet, or you don't know Python, it's worth starting here. You will quickly learn the basics of language and algorithmic thinking by creating your own games. Although you will create games without graphics, it will be a lot of fun!

### 2D games - Pygame Zero

This is where your adventure as a game creator begins. You will learn to create two-dimensional games and animations that you will be able to show to your loved ones and friends.

Before you go to this section, you should be familiar with the basics of programming in Python and a developer environment such as Pycharm.

### Artificial intelligence

Creating an opponent in a game that will be challenging, but at the same time the user will be able to defeat him is not so trivial! That is why it is worth learning how to use artificial intelligence to create the right level of challenge.

### Online games

Playing games on one computer alone or with several other people is great fun, but we can't always gather in one place. In this case, it is worth knowing how to create your own online game that will allow players from around the world to play with others.
