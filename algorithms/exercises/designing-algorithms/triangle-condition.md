# Triangle condition

## Problem description

The task is simple. You are given lengths of three segments. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to build a triangle from the given segments. Please refer to the specification below for the formal problem specification.

### Specification

#### Input

* a, b, c - integers, lengths of the segments

#### Output

* **YES** if a triangle can be build using the given segments, **NO** otherwise

### Example 1

#### Input

```
a := 5
b := 4
c := 6
```

**Output**: YES

### Example 2

#### Input

```
a := 3
b := 4
c := 1
```

**Output**: NO

## Exercise

Design an algorithm to solve the given problem. Think of as many different approaches as you can, there are at least three of them.

For each solution design a block diagram and pseudocode or implementation in your language of choice.
