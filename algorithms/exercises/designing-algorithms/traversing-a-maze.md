# Traversing a maze

## Problem description

You found yourself inside a maze. You don't know the layout of this maze and cannot see the way out, the walls are too tall. Find a way out!

## Exercise

Design an algorithm to find your way out of the maze. You can execute following actions:

* **check direction** - checks if there is a path in a given direction, where direction can be left, right, forward or backward, for example "**check left**"
* **move forward** - moves one step forward
* **turn left** - turns left
* **turn right** - turns right

Try to design a solution using a "right hand method". Is it possible to find a way out of any maze using this method?

Write a list of steps and draw a block diagram for your solution.
