# Computer Science: Hard Topics in Easiest Way

On this website you will find a discussion of various topics in the field of computer science.
Each topic is prepared in accordance with the slogan: practical and in the easiest way.
The materials are intended for anyone who wants to learn something, as well as for those who want to teach others.

Students will find here simple and short discussions of selected topics, and teachers will find interesting ideas for lessons.

## What is the difference between this page and similar ones that can be found on the web?

The site was prepared by a "programmer with an unusual hobby". Yes, I am an IT specialist by profession, I also worked as a programmer and I am constantly developing in this respect. In addition, I am interested in education and didactics. For many years I have been teaching computer science to children and adults at various levels. Many web pages with similar topics that I found on the web skip one of two important aspects: didactics or professionalism. Materials written professionally and with deep theoretical facilities are often difficult to understand and intended for university students rather than a mere mortal. On the other hand, many teaching materials in computer science lack professionalism: it can be seen that they were written by a person without a deeper experience in this field and unaware of good practices. When preparing materials available on my website, I try to remember about both aspects (of course, please report all errors and/or inaccuracies, to err is human).

The materials were prepared (as I mentioned) with the thought "in the simplest way" in mind and with respect for the reader's time. I try to ensure that everyone is able to understand the topics I discuss in a relatively short time. Therefore, I do not write on a dozen or so pages about a simple algorithm, but rather I focus on specifics and simple examples. On the other hand, of course, this means that I do not discuss some nuances, and I only mention some details. As they say: something for something. My materials should help understand the basics and the general idea, I refer interested in details to other sources.

The materials undergo their baptism by fire. I use them myself in class and I am asking my friends to review them. If I notice that something requires improvement or supplementation, I correct and/or complement. All comments can also be submitted, I invite you to look at the contact tab.
